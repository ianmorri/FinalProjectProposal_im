    <li> Application Overview: I want to make a web game where the user is able to put in as many characters as they want and they will then fight till one is left
        It will be similar to hunger games in a way, but text based.
    </li>

        time and math. It will be mostly text based, but it should show a lot of cool stuff on the website </li>
